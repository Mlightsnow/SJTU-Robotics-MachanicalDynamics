This repository contains the code of my course projects in SJTU
* In Robotics folder, there is my MATLAB code for kinematics and dynamics simulation of a 6DOF robot arm.
* In Machinery dynamics folder, there is my MATLAB code for Dynamic modeling, simulation and optimization of chaotic double pendulum. You can see more details in my **course project report**.
